# chatbot_ai_agent project

This project leverages the capabilities of an LLM, creates 3 tools and uses them to extract information from a dataframe. 
Capabilities: 
    - Retrieves information from table using SQL queries
    - Creates plots, but only lineplots are supported with sufficient tests

Requirements to run on your local machine:
1. Python version - 3.11
2. Hugging Face acount and token generated
3. Access to a Postgresql database

Project structure:

/datasets
    / dataframe to work on
/scripts
    / agent_info 
    
    / agent_tools              # tools created for the agent to use
    / plots_output             # plots generated by the agent
    / utils                    # DB connection and tool log
    / agent_script.py          # contains the agent 
    / EDA_and_postgresql.ipynb # EDA and table writing on DB

chatbot.ipynb                  # Here you interact with the chatbot
tests_chatbot.ipynb            # Testing chatbot outputs


In order to run the project on your machine, after completing the 3 requirements you must do the following:

    a. Create virtual env with: python -m venv .venv or any other name you want
    b. Activate the environment with: source .venv/bin/activate or wherever the location is
    c. Install requirements.txt with: pip install -r requirements.txt
    d. Run jupyter lab in the environment(in bash)

Warnings!
1. Too many calls and you might run out of credits on HF. 
2. The model can at time hallucinate, or the connection to be poor. Simply restart the kernel and run the code again.
